The Henchman package is a collection of frequently used utility functions for Featuretools demos. There are a number of functions which appear in multiple `utils.py` files in multiple demos. This project consolidates those into 4 categories of reusable functions: `dataframe diagnostics <documentation.html#diagnostics>`_, `feature selection
<documentation.html#selection>`_, `machine learning <documentation.html#learning>`_ and `bokeh plotting <documentation.html#plotting>`_.
